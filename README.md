## Instructions for Students (Before Coming to Class)

### Accessing Materials & Following Along Live in Class

Clone a copy of this repository using Git.
To clone a copy of this repository to your own PC:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/tisem-digital-marketing/smwa-causation-code.git
```

Once you have cloned the files, open the cloned repository in RStudio as an RStudio project and use the empty R scripts to follow along with the lecture as we work through material.

At the conclusion of the class, the course instructor's scripts are made available in the branch `instructor`.
Recall that you can switch between branches using the `git branch <BRANCHNAME>` command in a terminal.
Thus to switch to the instructor branch:

```{bash}
git branch instructor
```

And to switch back to the branch that you worked through live in class:

```{bash}
git branch main
```

*NOTE*: Git does not like you to switch branches with uncommitted changes.
Before you switch branches, be sure to commit any changes to the files.

### Installing required packages

This lecture makes use of additional `R` packages.

Install these packages **before** coming to class.
